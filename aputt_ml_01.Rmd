2. Import the dataset into R
```{r}
library(readr)
insurance <- read_csv("C:/Trading detail/STUDY/01_MSBA/02 MSBA ML/Dataset/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets-master/insurance.csv")
View(insurance)

```

3. Print out descriptive statistics for a selection of quantitative and categorical variables.
```{r}
summary(insurance)
```

```{r}
loginsurance = log(insurance$age)
summary(loginsurance)
```
